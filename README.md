# Hospital-Patient-Appointment-System
This is a minimal hospital appointment management demo written in C language, showcasing the use of core data structures such as linked lists, binary search trees (BST), circular queues, arrays, and stacks.  The project simulates a simple hospital system where patients, doctors, and appointments are managed through a text-based menu.
